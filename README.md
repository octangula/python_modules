## how to use:
- include the .py file for the module you wish to use in the same folder as your project
- import it at the beginning of your code with `from <file> import <function>`

then simply use the function/s in your own python file </br>
ie: `from nested_key_search import nested_key_search` and then use the nested_key_search() function with necessary args
